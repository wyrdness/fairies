      "full": "Fairies (also known as the Fae or Sidhe) are supernatural beings deeply rooted in Celtic mythology and European folklore. While often depicted in modern culture as tiny, winged, benevolent creatures, traditional fairy lore presents a far more complex and sometimes dangerous picture. The Fae are believed to be a separate race of supernatural beings—possibly remnants of ancient gods (Tuatha Dé Danann), nature spirits, or ancestral memories—who inhabit the Otherworld, a parallel realm that overlaps with our own. Fairy encounters traditionally involve time distortion, enchantment, abduction, and the exchange of human children for changelings. Traditional Celtic cultures treated the Fae with great respect and caution, using euphemisms like \\\"Fair Folk\\\" or \\\"Good Neighbors\\\" to avoid offending them. Fairy belief spans from ancient pre-Christian traditions through medieval folklore to modern encounters and cultural revivals, remaining a living tradition in Celtic regions today."
