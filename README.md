## Overview

Fairies (also known as the Fae or Sidhe) are supernatural beings deeply rooted in Celtic mythology and European folklore. While often depicted in modern culture as tiny, winged, benevolent creatures, traditional fairy lore presents a far more complex and sometimes dangerous picture.

The Fae are believed to be a separate race of supernatural beings—possibly remnants of ancient gods (Tuatha Dé Danann), nature spirits, or ancestral memories—who inhabit the Otherworld, a parallel realm that overlaps with our own. Fairy encounters traditionally involve time distortion, enchantment, abduction, and the exchange of human children for changelings.

Traditional Celtic cultures treated the Fae with great respect and caution, using euphemisms like "Fair Folk" or "Good Neighbors" to avoid offending them. Fairy belief spans from ancient pre-Christian traditions through medieval folklore to modern encounters and cultural revivals, remaining a living tradition in Celtic regions today.

## Notable Cases & Encounters

### Rev. Robert Kirk Disappearance (1692) ⭐

> **Date**: 1692
> **Location**: Fairy Hill (Doon Hill), Aberfoyle, Scotland
> **Witness**: Rev. Robert Kirk, Episcopal minister and scholar

Rev. Robert Kirk, author of *The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns and Fairies* (1691), collapsed on Fairy Hill and died. Local tradition holds he was taken by the fairies for revealing their secrets. He allegedly appeared to a relative after death, claiming to be held by the Fae.

**Credibility**: Historical figure, real death, circumstances suspicious. Fairy connection added posthumously by local tradition.

---

### Bridget Cleary Changeling Case (1895) ⭐

> **Date**: March 15, 1895
> **Location**: Ballyvadlea, County Tipperary, Ireland
> **Witnesses**: Husband Michael Cleary, family members, neighbors

26-year-old Bridget Cleary fell ill. Her husband and relatives became convinced she was a changeling and the real Bridget was held by fairies. They subjected her to "fairy tests" including holding her over a fire to force the fairy to flee. Bridget died from burns and beatings. Michael and others were tried for manslaughter.

**Significance**: Demonstrates persistence of changeling belief in late 19th century Ireland. Real case with tragic outcome; Bridget was human—belief killed her.

**Quote**: *"Are you Bridget Cleary, wife of Michael Cleary, in the name of God?"* — Words spoken during the "tests"

### Cottingley Fairies Photographs (1917)

> **Date**: 1917
> **Location**: Cottingley, Yorkshire, England
> **Witnesses**: Elsie Wright (16) and Frances Griffiths (9)

Two young cousins produced photographs appearing to show them with fairies. The images caused sensation when championed by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In 1983, the women admitted the photos were faked using cardboard cutouts, though Frances maintained she really saw fairies.

**Status**: Debunked hoax, but significant cultural phenomenon showing desire to believe persisted into modern era.
